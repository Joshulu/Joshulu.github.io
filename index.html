        <h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>
        <p>
          I didn't start out life wanting to be a developer.  I always wanted to
          be this until I wanted to be that, and so forth.  I took up TaeKwonDo 
          for a couple years.  I switched to piano for the next 4.  For the 
          longest time, I wanted my mother to send me to China so I could learn 
          Buddism as a Shaolin Monk(I say Buddism but really I wanted Kung Fu 
          and would willingly be devout Buddist to get that).  I wanted to be an 
          Accupuncturist since the beginning of Middle School.  I had a change of
          heart in High School and decided Engineering (I also taught myself 
          guitar, ukulele, some accordian, and anything I could get my hands on).  
          Tried Engineering in college(while learning JiuJitsu and Aikido, tried 
          Art in college, took one C++ programming class as I tried Engineering again . . .
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways, the point isn't about how scattered my heart is.  I like to 
          think of it as a journey of self discovery.  I may never know what 
          truly satisfies my heart (besides my wife, I mean).  I may never find
          the one thing society tells us we need to find, to define our humanity, 
          our lives, our purpose. . .but I think that's rubbish.  We're all from 
          different walks of life.  Within me, I feel like there's all sorts of 
          things I've yet to discover.  Different walks of my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each part of me loves to create...Music, Art, Philosophy, Science, 
          Politics, and more.  Programming can be a tool to gain access to, and 
          further each of my passions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh and I still can't wait to visit China someday.
