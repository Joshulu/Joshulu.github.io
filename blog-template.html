      Two-Face: I just the took to calling it the Bat. And yes Mr. Wayne, it does come in black.</p>

<p>Joker: Never start with the head. The victim gets all fuzzy. He can't feel the next... See?</p>

<p>Batman: Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread.</p>

<p>Bane: Peace has cost you your strength. Victory has defeated you.</p>

<p>Bane: I'm Gotham's reckoning. It'll end the ball of damns you've all been living on. A necessary evil.</p>

<p>Alfred: Because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just wanna watch the world burn.</p>

<p>Bane: It will be extremely painful... for you</p>

<p>Alfred: Batman may have made the front page but Bruce Wayne got pushed to page eight.</p>

<p>Batman: It was a dog. It was a big dog.</p>

<p>Bane: Your Punishment Must Be More Severe.</p>

<p>Bane: I am the League of Shadows.</p>

<p>Falcone: Look around you. You'll see two councilmen, a union official, couple off-duty cops and a judge. I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of blowing your head off in front of them. Now, that's power you can't buy. That's the power of fear.</p>

<p>Joker: This town deserves a better class of criminal and I'm gonna give it to them. Tell your men they work for me now. This is my city.</p>

<p>Alfred: I give a damn because a good man once made me responsible for what was most precious to him in the whole world.</p>

        <p>Yeah! Okay! Hello, boys. Dad! If youre hearing this prerecorded hologram message, its because I passed on, and my spirit sparkles guided you to its secret hiding place. Right now, Im holding both of you in my hands. Youre both still little squishy babies. I made you boys something. Its a dungeon. A proper dungeon. Full of evil monsters, traps, and magic.</p>

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was pretty cool to see each others' ideas in real time.  It lets the creative process flow between two people.  I really enjoyed how simple HTML is so far.  It's not nearly a complete product, but it's a start and you have to savor the little victories.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Yeah I think so.  I can imagine it almost perfectly, but seeing it visually kind of acts as a checklist when it comes to filling out the HTML part.  I might glaze over things if I didn't have a map to look at.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

We both kind of bounced ideas off one another.  I was lacking in the wireframe skill to keep up, so my pair took over for most of it while I kind of got the hang of the tools a little.  It was a few tweaks here and there, but we generally agreed that the design was good enough for such an early stage.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

Well I learned aside, section, article, footer, header, main, nav, and time.
