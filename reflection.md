-What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

From this challenge, I didn't learn much new.  I already studies the box model from previous challenges.  Padding is a buffer between your content and your border.  Margins are a buffer between your border and other elements.

-What did you learn about CSS positioning?

It's tricky!  Moving one item around can mess up your other elements if you're not paying attention.  Be careful using too many floats.  Other than that I stick to using percent measurements.

-What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

Easiest so far is aligning content on the page, but getting it too that point is the hard part.  Knowing which position and display to use and when to use them is still challenging.

-What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

It is very time consuming.  In html, you can just keep typing for the most part.  However, in CSS, you have to constantly check that what you're doing is working, or not working in most cases so far.
