        <h4>Ruby Classes</h4>
        <p>
          Today we're going to talk about computers...
          well sort of.  We're really going to talk about 
          classes.  Classes are basically everything you 
          work with in Ruby.  Strings, Integers, Arrays, etc. 
          are all Classes.
        </p>
        <h4>Computer Class</h4>
        <p>
          Okay, after that very breif introduction, we should 
          be ready to talk about a made up class.  We're going
           to call this class Computer.  Now, a String class
           is familiar enough to know that "string" is an
           instance of the String class.  But what does our
           Computer class create?  That happens to be up to us!
        </p>
        <h4>Computer Methods</h4>
        <p>
          When a class is defined it has an initialize method
           this tells our Class#new method to create a new
           instance of our class.  Not all classes work this
           way but most user generated classes do (from what
           I've seen).
        </p>
        <p>
          Well what else can we do?  What else does a computer
           do?  Well they can search the internet, they can
           search within themselves, they can store files,
           retrieve files, and display files (I know they do
           more than this, but this is a good sample).
        </p>
        <p>
          So let's use some code now:
        </p>
        <p>
          <pre><code>
            class Computer
              def initialize
              end
              
              def search_internet
              end
              
              def search_self
              end
              
              def save_file
              end
              
              def retrieve_file
              end

              def display
              end
            end
            
            my_pc = Computer.new
            my_pc.search_internet("Cats")
            my_pc.save_file(cat_picture.gif)
            my_pc.search_self(cat_picture.gif)
            my_pc.retrieve_file(cat_picture.gif)
          </code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          All the stuff from <code>class Computer</code> until the <code>end</code>
           at the bottom is the class definition for Computer.
           All the <code>'def ...'</code> are our methods we can use on an
           instance of our class (Just like array.each).
           After our class definition we have some, what we
           would call, driver code.  It runs our class
           definition.  We're creating my_pc which will behave
           exactly how Computer class says it will.  We can
           create more Computer objects like your_pc or
           work_pc.  Now, just like #each, we're saying
           my_pc.do-something, but we can only do what we've
           defined in our class.  (we can write anything in
           our definitions, they're just there as an example).
        </p>
        <h4>Computer Varialbes</h4>
        <p>
          In Ruby, when we have a variable <code>x = 5</code>
           for example, our code only knows that <code>x = 5</code> where
           it was defined.  If we look at a couple methods
           of our Computer class below:
          <pre><code>
            def save_file
            @saved_file = "filename"
            x = 5
            end
              
            def retrieve_file
            print @saved_file
            x = 6
            end
          </code></pre>
          
          We have a couple things going on.  We have an
           <code>x = 5</code>
           a <code>@saved_file = "filename"</code>
           and a <code>x = 6</code>.
           
          Normally, our x in our save_file method stays there.
           So our other x in retrieve_file does not overwrite
           our first x.  In no way do they interfere with one
           another.  However, for our <code>@saved_file</code>
           variable, we ARE accessing it in our #retrieve_file
           method.  That @ symbol out in front of the variable
           tells Ruby, "This variable is an instance variable,
           you can access it anywhere in your class."
        </p>
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>
          So we have a class Computer, we can call methods on
           it, and we can share(or not) variables within our
           entire class definition.  That is the basics of
           Ruby classes and how they're structured and used.
