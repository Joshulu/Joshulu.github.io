        <h4>The Big Deal About Brains</h4>
        <p>
          I mean PCs.  I keep saying stuff like that...But it probably has to do with brains working very similarly to computers, or maybe computers work like brains...Who knows which came first.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we boil everything down, computers are just like everything else in the world.  Things that react to stimuli.  We react to stimuli, other animals react to stimuli, even plants and trees react.  We can go as far out as the planet, the stars, and indeed the universe.  We made computers, however, to react to us and things we needed them to react to.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I want to talk about how PCs and brains (human at least) work very similarly.  Perhaps as we've learned, and continue to learn more, about how our brains work, we can make more sophisticated computers.
        </p>
        <h4>Parts Of The PC</h4>
        <p>
          Without putting our PCs under the knife, we can break them down into basic parts.  We have:
          <ul>
            <li>STIMULUS: that's us for the most part</li>
            <li>INPUT: when we touch the keyboard, mouse, touch screen, etc.</li>
            <li>COMPUTER STUFF: from some ancient technomancy, translates our input into..</li>
            <li>OUTPUT: usually a monitor of some sort</li>
            <li>RINSE, LATHER, REPEAT</li>
          </ul>
          That's the general idea of it anyways.  You can imagine that getting slapped would be input, and our surprise and good old friend pain is our output.  Instead of sorcery, however, we're dealing with biology...much more frightening if you ask me.
        </p>
        <h4>The Actual Parts Of The PC</h4>
        <p>
          So each computer is different, depending on the needs of it.  Computer means input *turns into output (*technomancy).  But, let's talk about, arguably the most common, the PC.
