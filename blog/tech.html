        <h4>The Big Deal About Brains</h4>
        <p>
          I mean PCs.  I keep saying stuff like that...But it probably has to do with brains working very similarly to computers, or maybe computers work like brains...Who knows which came first.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we boil everything down, computers are just like everything else in the world.  Things that react to stimuli.  We react to stimuli, other animals react to stimuli, even plants and trees react.  We can go as far out as the planet, the stars, and indeed the universe.  We made computers, however, to react to us and things we needed them to react to.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I want to talk about how PCs and brains (human at least) work very similarly.  Perhaps as we've learned, and continue to learn more, about how our brains work, we can make more sophisticated computers.
        </p>
        <h4>Parts Of The PC</h4>
        <p>
          Without putting our PCs under the knife, we can break them down into basic parts.  We have:
          <ul>
            <li>STIMULUS: that's us for the most part</li>
            <li>INPUT: when we touch the keyboard, mouse, touch screen, etc.</li>
            <li>COMPUTER STUFF: from some ancient technomancy, translates our input into..</li>
            <li>OUTPUT: usually a monitor of some sort</li>
            <li>RINSE, LATHER, REPEAT</li>
          </ul>
          That's the general idea of it anyways.  You can imagine that getting slapped would be input, and our surprise and good old friend pain is our output.  Instead of sorcery, however, we're dealing with biology...much more frightening if you ask me.
        </p>
        <h4>The Actual Parts Of The PC</h4>
        <p>
          So each computer is different, depending on the needs of it.  Computer means input *turns into output (*technomancy).  But, let's talk about, arguably the most common, the PC.
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Motherboard: this is the central circuit board of the computer.  Everything goes through it in some fashion.  It determines what ports you can have, how much RAM you can have, etc.  If your motherboard isn't up to snuff, the rest of your computer isn't.</li>
            <span><li>Thalamus: a lot like the motherboard.  It's a part of our brain that transmits information to the correct places.  When our eyes capture light, it goes to the thalamus first, then the thalamas decides to send it to the occipital lobe to process as images.  If it's a sound it goes to, conveniently, the primary auditory cortex.</li></span>
            <li>CPU: Central Processing Unit.  Intel and AMD mostly make them, though you've probably only heard of Intel on T.V.  They operate pretty much completely on 64bit architecture now (which is just a fancy way of saying it can hold more information while processing it).  And clock speed, in general, is how fast it can process the information.  A very average 2 GHz, at peak, means the CPU can do 1,000 000,000 computations per second.</li>
            <span><li>General Brain: the CPU equivilent would just be your entire brain.  You want to do something, but you don't really have to actively think abou it.  Your brain registers all your automatic functions, active functions, and thoughts simultaneously.  It takes in all our sensory information (mostly drowns out static info) with some parts of our body being extremely sensitive.  Your fingers can detect bumps on a flat surface, something like 50 times smaller thinner than human hair.</li></span>
            <li>RAM: Random Access Memory is the buffer your CPU needs to store the information it is processing.  Having more RAM doesn't make your computer faster, it's the combination of RAM and CPU that make fast computers.</li>
            <span><li>Nervous System: A good analogy to RAM.  Our fingers touch something, but our brains don't automatically know that.  It gets sent to our spine along a network, then up to our brain.  If you visit webites and they store cookies to help it load faster each time you visit, your body does the same thing.  Some information doesn't even need to reach your brain.  Many reflexes, especially pain, go to the spine and straight back.  Which is why you might touch a hot stove and jerk away before you say "Ow!"</li></span>
          </ul>
          There's a lot of other things that go into computers, like software, ports, and drives, that make them work the way they do, but I've covered most of the basics I think.  I think I've made my point as well.
        </p>
        <h4>Better Life Science == Better Computer Science</h4>
        <p>
          Computers are great.  They weren't always as great as they are now.  Heck, a graphing calculator has a lot of computing power compared to the first computers.  They're a complex, intricate network of wires, cards, circuits, I/O, powered by electricity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think, the more we further understand ourselves and our surroundings, the more we can tailor computers to do more for us.  There are articles you can look up about how our brains don't just use each part of the brain seperately.  Blind people literally can see with their hands.  The information their fingers pick up get processed by the visual cortex.  People can hear with their tongues.  People have gotten a camera jacked into their optic nerve, and the brain translates that information into something it can use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine if the componenets of a computer could replace one another or work in unison to be faster, more accurate, more powerful.  The future of computers is awesome, as is the future of discovering ourselves and how the two interact with each other.
