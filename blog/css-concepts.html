        <h4>
          There Are Four Types of Positions
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Relative</li>
          <li>Absolute</li>
          <li>Fixed</li>
          <li>and Static</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Relative</h4>
        <p>
          The relative position lets one position an html element somewhere other than its default place.  It's pretty much that simple (most of the time).  To move an html element(element), you must define it's position as relative via: <span>position: relative;</span> .  After that you can use left, right, top, and bottom to add space on that side.  For example, <span>top: 20px;</span> add 20 pixels to the space above the element, essentially moving it down.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Absolute</h4>
        <p>
          This will get confusing now, so bear with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          The absolute position works the same as relative, except in a different way.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I know...what I mean is, relative uses the entire window.  Our <span>top: 20px</span> moves us 20 pixels from the top of the window.  If we did the same code in an absolute position, we'd move 20 pixels down from the nearest element in any position, besides the default position.
          
          When I say nearest, I mean nearest element above the absolute element, in the html code.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Fixed</h4>
        <p>
          That's it for the confusing part.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fixed position defines an element from the entire window again.  You can move it with top, bottom, left, and right.  The difference with this one is, once you tell it where it belongs, it never moves.  You can scroll down, up, sideways, etc.  No matter what you do, that fixed element will stay on screen.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Static</h4>
        <p>
          That went by fast, huh?  So will this one don't worry.
        </p>
        <p>
          The static position is...the default position!  This is what all elements start out as.  you don't have to define them as static.  By default, static elements plop themselves all right down in a column, just like on the html file.  What you read in order there, will show up on the web page.
        </p>
        
        <h4>What else?</h4>
        <p>Lots else!</p>
        <p>
          You can further modify these positions with all sorts of CSS properties!  This is just the beginning of how websites are made!  Do some more research if you're interested in how people do things like drop down menus, changing colors, etc.  Pretty much everything that makes a website pretty!
